# Game description:

### Notes:
- There is a 5s server-enforced buffer for scene loads, so in-game scene
  lengths will be slightly longer than the scene duration, in order to ensure
  phases are not cut off short in case of client slowdown.
- The phases are strictly chronological, the game can not advance to the next
  state without evaluating all previous states, game phases are irreverable.
